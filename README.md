# Flying-bird
This is a Pygame-based Flappy Bird clone. It has a bird you control with the spacebar to jump, avoiding a series of constantly moving pipes. The game features distinct states for the intro, active play, and game over. It tracks your score and detects collisions, resetting the game upon failure.
